<h1>What you need to know about revenue recognition</h1>

<h2>Time is running out! Private entitites must understand the new standard by Jan. 1, 2019.</h2>

<p>In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which added Topic 606 to the FASBâ€™s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and will replace almost all pre-existing revenue recognition guidance in legacy generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with a robust framework for addressing how an entity should account for its revenue. Implementation by calendar year-end public entities was required byJanuary 1, 2018 and is required by other calendar year-end entities no later than the year ending December 31, 2019.</p>
